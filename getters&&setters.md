### What are getters and setters?
- getters and setters are modifiers of a variable. Essentially they are a custom function that is declared at the initialization of a variable.
- Usual Example: if I am going to use an Int variable **age** and I know that the value of that variable will be changed under a condition, like a simple calculation, I might be tempted to declare **age** as _nil_, or _0_, and then create a function called 'calculateAge()' to update the **age** variable:

- New Example: instead of making different functions for running code when setting, or getting the value of the **age** property of Person, we can add those modifiers right after declaring the properties:

- a setter is a block of code that is executed at the time when a new value has been **set** to the variable

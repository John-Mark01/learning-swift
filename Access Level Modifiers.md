# Swift's Access Level Modifiers
- theese in all programing languages are something like clearance toa venue. Or maybe like a top secret files.
- Swift has **5** access levels, that follows:
### 1. Private
  - When created a property/method with a private modifier, this property/method is limited to be accessed only inside the __SCOPE__ of which they are created at. 
  - private properties/methods are the most limited of all Access Modifiers
### 2. FilePrivate
  - Property/Method is only accessable within the __FILE__ that is created.
  - you can't access this property/method from another file. It is only global for the file that is in.
### 3. Internal - default for all of swift's properies and method
  - **If you don't add ANY access modifier (public, private, etc.) all of the properties will be marked as INTERNAL by default**
  - Property/methods are accesable anywhere within your current app module.
